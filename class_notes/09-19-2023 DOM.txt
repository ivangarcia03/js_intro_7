    console.log(window); // ReferenceError: window is not defined
    Because we are running our code in NodeJS environment

    console.log(window); // Window object

alert() - method

prompt() - method
    1. null - if you cancel it
    2. string value that user inputs to the prompt


confirm() - method
    1. true - if you pressed OK

localStorage
    We can store [key value] paired data.
    Your data will live in localStorage indefinitely
    When storing object and array we have to use JSON.stringify() to convert to string and JSON.parse() convert from string
    To remove item from localStorage use => localStorage.removeItem(name)
