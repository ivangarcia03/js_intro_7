this keyword

JavaScript is a functional programming language
this keyword is a key to know where(which lexical context) your function is called

function printName(name) {
    console.log(name);
}

printName() // this = window

But if you want to change the value of this, meaning function invokation place(context)
Use either of these:
1. call (pass arguments one by one)
2. apply (pass array of argument all together)
3. bind ()

Arrow functions doesn't have its own "this" and it always look from parent
