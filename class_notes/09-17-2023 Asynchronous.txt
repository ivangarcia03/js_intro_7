Synchronous Tasks vs Asynchronous Tasks

setTimeout() -> function that can help us to delay a task


callback -> its a function that gets passed to another function as an argument

Callback hell occurs when you have multiple nested callbacks within callbacks, 
this leads to code being hard to understand and prone to errors.

How to handle async code in javascript?
1. Callbacks
2. Promises
3. Async/await


Promise 

Makes working with asynchronous code even easier than callbacks
Its just object
This object has 3 states:
    1. Fullfilled -> success
    2. Pending -> pending
    3. Rejected -> fail


When you resolve the promise use: then and catch 
then() => when promise is Fullfilled
catch() => when promise is failed


Async await Error Handling
    - use try catch block
