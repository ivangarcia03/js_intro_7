Modules


Without modules the order of javascript files is very important
Example: putting main.js before math.js will fail.

Goal is to have only one entry point to my project

1 html -> 1 js file

1 js file -> may have many dependcies


COMMONJS  ------

In order to use CommonJS syntax (modules.exports, require) in the browser
we have to use some libraries such as require.js, browserify (webpack, babel)

Does NodeJS support CommonJS syntax? - Yes
Node enviorment supports CommonJS syntax by default.
No need to use any external library


Export/Import ES6 Syntax ----
1. Named export and import (Multiple export imports allowed in single file/module. You should import with the exact name)
2. Default export (only 1 default export is allowed in a file/module)
3. Rename exports when importing them using `as` keyword: import {add as dateAdd} from '';
4. Aggregation

Difference regular js vs modules
