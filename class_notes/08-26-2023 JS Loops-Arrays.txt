Loops: 


1. For Loop
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    console.log(i);
}


2. While Loop
3. Do-while Loop 
4. For...of Loop
5. For..in Loop


Infinite loop: That is a loop never stops due to a logical mistake and termination point is never met.

for(; ;){
    // Infinite loop
}



i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0              =>              i % 15 === 0


2. while loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
You can do any task you did with for loop using while loop.

Syntax:

while(condition){
    // code block to execute
}


While vs For loops
For loop is used to execute a block of code and preferred when we know the exact number of iterations.
While loop is used to execute a block of based on a condition and total number of iteration is not certain (dynamic).
While loop can be used instead of for loop and visa versa

3. Do-While loop
The do-while loop is a variant of the while loop. 
This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

Syntax:

do {
   // code block to execute 
}
while(condition);

4. For-of loop
The for of loop is used to loop through the values of an iterable object such as Arrays, Strings, Maps and more.

Syntax:
for(variable of iterable) {
    // code block to execute 
}
